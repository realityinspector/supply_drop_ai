CONTEXT In the past week, Los Angeles has been grappling with severe wildfires, notably the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have collectively scorched over 40,000 acres. These fires have led to at least 24 fatalities and the destruction of more than 12,000 structures, prompting evacuation orders affecting over 180,000 residents. The situation remains critical as strong Santa Ana winds are forecasted, potentially exacerbating the fires and hindering containment efforts. Authorities have also reported incidents of looting in evacuated areas, resulting in numerous arrests. The economic impact is substantial, with damage estimates ranging between $250 billion to $275 billion. Business Insider Hurricane Helene, which made landfall in late September 2024, caused catastrophic damage across the Southeastern United States, particularly in Florida and the Carolinas. As the strongest hurricane on record to strike Florida's Big Bend region, Helene brought winds up to 140 mph and unprecedented rainfall, leading to severe flooding and mudslides. The storm resulted in over 230 fatalities, making it the deadliest U.S. hurricane since 2017, and caused damages exceeding $78 billion. Recovery efforts are ongoing, with federal block grants totaling over $1.65 billion recently awarded to North Carolina to aid in rebuilding homes, infrastructure, and supporting small businesses.
