# Document-Aware Chatbot System for Disaster Preparedness

A comprehensive document-aware chatbot system designed specifically for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery contexts. This system enables secure document processing and interactive chat functionality to support individuals and communities through all phases of disaster management. The system implements user authentication, document upload/processing capabilities, and persistent storage of conversations and documents to provide continuity of support during crisis situations.

## Disaster Preparedness Context

Disasters—whether natural (hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, floods) or man-made—create unique challenges that require specialized information systems:

1. **Information Access During Crisis**: During disasters, normal information channels may be disrupted while the need for accurate information becomes critically important.

2. **Complex Application Processes**: Post-disaster recovery typically involves navigating complex application processes for aid from multiple agencies (FEMA, insurance, state programs, non-profits) during a time of extreme stress.

3. **Environmental Hazards**: Disasters often create secondary environmental hazards (toxic exposure, contaminated water, air quality issues) that require assessment and mitigation.

4. **Resource Coordination**: Resources during disasters are often limited and dynamic, requiring real-time information about availability and access procedures.

5. **Digital Divide Considerations**: Disaster-affected populations may have limited technological access, requiring systems designed for accessibility across various devices and connectivity levels.

6. **Documentation Challenges**: Critical documents (property deeds, insurance policies, identification) may be destroyed during disasters, complicating application processes.

## System Overview

This application provides multiple specialized tools to address these disaster-specific challenges:

1. **Resource Finder**: Locates emergency resources using a chatbot with access to public data sources, including community resource directories. Helps users quickly find shelters, food distribution points, medical aid, and other critical services in their area during and after disasters.

2. **Rejection Simulation**: A tool that simulates real application processes for insurance, FEMA, or grants to help users prepare stronger applications. This addresses the high rejection rate in disaster assistance applications due to technical errors or documentation issues.

3. **Toxicity Assessment**: Evaluates environmental exposure risks following disasters, including air quality concerns, water contamination risks, and potential chemical exposures from damaged infrastructure. Provides guidance on mitigation strategies.

4. **Recovery Capital Finder**: Searches a database of disaster recovery funding sources and programs across government, non-profit, and private sectors. Helps affected individuals and organizations identify all potential assistance sources relevant to their specific situation.
